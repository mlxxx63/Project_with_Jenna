            easily share your favourite songs and artists with each other. Our program allows you to

            so your friends can easily give your music tastes a try. You will be
            able to add Youtube links to each song so you can easily find them,
            allowing you to listen to them as well.</p>

                    you will type <b>1</b> and then hit the <em>enter</em> key on your keyboard.
                    The program will then ask you how many playlists you would like to create.
                    Type in the number you would like and then hit the <em>enter</em> key. 
                    It will then ask you for the name of your playlist. This is where you type in the name 
                    and again hit the <em>enter</em> key. Afterwards it will ask you for the genre of the
                    playlist. You will again type out the genre and hit the <em>enter</em> key. The program
                    will get you to repeat these steps until it has finished adding all the playlists
                    you wanted to add. After adding all the playlists, it will print out the playlists you created
                    including the name and number of the playlist (each playlist is given a number so it
                    can be found easily). Function 1 ends and you will be prompted with the <b>Main Menu</b> again.</p>
